### SOA: Simple Image Server
##### Middleware Technologies for Distributed Systems (AY 2015/2016)

The goal of this project is to create an Image Server. The Image Server should provide a REST API for:
- creating new users (each user should have a unique id and a name)
- listing the users in the system
- uploading .jpg images to a user's online storage space (each image should have a unique key and a title)
- listing the available images by user id
- obtaining the images from the server

The API should be developed in such a way as to support Hypermedia. Furthermore, the Image Server's REST API should also support *OAuth* to allow third party applications to access a user's images.
